vimconfig
=========

My own vim config with plugins (exept cscope, it needs to be installed into os)

INSTALL
=======

Run in command line:

1. cd vimconfig
2. sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
3. ./install.sh 

Notice: 
1. You can set your own path where would you like to put your plugins and config, please just add -p <path without '/' at the end>  
Default value is /home/$USER/.vim
2. You can install vimconfig in force mode, if you set -f flag.
It will delete your old config and config path that you set or default one.

That's All.
